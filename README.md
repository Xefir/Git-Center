Git-Center
==========

Automate push and pull from your git remote repositories

How to use ?
----------

Copy (not rename) the config.sample.php to config.php and edit the settings to fit with your own servers.

What I need to run it ?
----------

Nothing more than a web server with PHP 5 installed.
**Your git clients must be in english**

Why ?
----------

We will take an exemple :
You have a git repo on your server and you are bored to connect on SSH in it, make a git fetch, then a git pull or git commit / push.
I understand that and this is why I create Git Center.

What it does ?
----------

Exactly what I said earlier, it connect to your server on SSH with you login and pass or SSH private key and do the usual git commands.
